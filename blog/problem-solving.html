        Hi peers and friends, I'm excited to share that we've reached Sprint 4,
        and I'm proud to say that we've completed over half of the foundation!
        In this sprint, we'll get deeper into JavaScript Methods, JavaScript
        modules, and Problem-Solving Skilli. Today's focus in the blog will be
        on honing our Problem-Solving Skilli.

        In this sprint, I've been learning about Testing, Problem Solving,
        Pseudocoding, and revisiting some basic techniques covered in sprint 1.
        During the JavaScript-kata task, I encountered the "undefined" error
        several times. Despite using the Rubber Ducky method, where I talked
        through each line of code, I couldn't figure out the issue. I even
        looked up the syntax of the method I used in the code, but that didn't
        help either. Feeling a bit frustrated, I searched for "function result
        undefined," and it turned out I forgot to return the result. As a
        beginner coder, I've learned that most errors at this stage are due to
        syntax or typos, rather than algorithms.

        In the Super-Fizzbuzz task, I pseudocoded the problem and encountered an
        issue on how to iterate over every element in the array. While I could
        have done it manually, I wondered if there was a built-in method
        available. After searching on Google, I found the forEach method, which
        made the code cleaner and simpler. Is it elegant ?

        what problem-solving techniques/processes I used the most ?

        I rarely use these problem-solving techniques or processes because I
        prefer to get immediate help when I ask for it. If coaches or peers were
        sitting beside me, I'd be more likely to ask for assistance. Another
        reason is that I feel accomplished when I figure out the solution myself
        rather than getting the answer from others. However, if I exhaust all my
        options and still can't solve the problem, I'm open to asking for help.
