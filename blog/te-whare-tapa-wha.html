        Te Whare Tapa Whā is a holistic health model developed by Sir Mason
        Durie, a prominent Māori health advocate from New Zealand. It represents
        the four dimensions of Māori well-being: taha tinana (physical health),
        taha hinengaro (mental and emotional health), taha whānau (family and
        social health), and taha wairua (spiritual health).
      </p>

      <p class="p-style2">
        Exploring this core cultural aspect, I've encountered a holistic health
        model originating from New Zealand Maori culture, which is entirely new
        to me. With its four-dimensional framework, I'm motivated to develop a
        personalized well-being plan using the Te Whare Tapa Whā model.

      <p class="p-style2">
        Taha tinana (physical wellbeing) : It encompasses aspects such as
        exercise, nutrition, rest, and physical activity. A balanced taha tinana
        contributes to overall well-being and vitality. following activities are what I can do to improve my Taha tinana
        <ul>
          <li> Having a After-dinner stroll with my famliy in park </li>
          <li>A meditation before going to bed, improve quality sleep</li>
          <li>Doing some stretch exercise, during my long shift work</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="div11">
      <p class="p-style2">
        Taha Hinengaro (emotional and mental wellbeing) : It involves having a positive outlook, managing stress, and maintaining mental clarity. Emotional resilience and the ability to cope with life's challenges are essential components of this dimension. Over the past two months, life has been quite stressful for me. I embarked on part-time learning at Dev Academy while juggling a full-time job, and our house was on the market. Additionally, unexpected family matters arose that required my attention. Despite these pressures, I'm grateful that I didn't feel overwhelmed. I managed stress effectively and successfully sorted things out.
        <ul>
          <li>Having a quality time  with  famliy, video chat with my parents as much as possible</li>
          <li>A meditation before going to bed</li>
          <li>control screen time, spend more time in outdoor</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="div11">
      <p class="p-style2">
        Taha Whānau (family wellbeing) : Strong relationships with family members, friends, and the wider community contribute to a sense of belonging and support network. Cultural identity and traditions also play a significant role in this dimension. Family holds the utmost importance in our lives.Having lived in New Zealand for five years, navigating through the challenges, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic, has been particularly difficult.Being unable to visit our parents, and their yearning to see their grandchildren, especially the youngest, whom they haven't met. Moreover, due to time differences, staying connected with friends has become less frequent. I'm resolved to enhance these relationships and prioritize them during this period
        <ul>
          <li>Having a quality time  with  famliy, video chat with my parents as much as possible</li>
          <li>connect with friends frequently</li>
          <li>maintaining relationship with my wife and kids</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="div11">
      <p class="p-style2">
        Taha Wairua (spiritual wellbeing) : It involves connecting with one's inner self, cultural beliefs, and spiritual practices. This dimension encompasses a sense of purpose, meaning, and connection to the land, ancestors, and the universe.
        <ul>
          <li>Having a After-dinner stroll with my famliy in park </li>
          <li>A meditation before going to bed, improve quality sleep</li>
          <li>Doing some stretch exercise, during my long shift work</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="div11">
      <p class="p-style2">
        Whenua (land) : As the foundation for the other 4 dimensions, the health of the land and the natural environment is strongly connected to my health and wellbeing.
