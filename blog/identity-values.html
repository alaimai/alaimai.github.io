                <span class="qa">A</span>:I was born and raised in China, as a Chinese, my values and identity are deeply influenced by Chinese culture and people.
                Chinese culture put an important value on education and academic achievement. The higher education and academic achievement you get the better career and personal fulfilment achieved. So I joined to Dev academy in order to start a new career.  
                Work Ethic Chinese people often are described as diligence, hard working. My parents used to tell me that you have to work hard to achieve your career goals. It has been deeply ingrained in my values. After I have lived in NZ for years, I heard people said "work hard, play hard". It has come to me that work is not all your life, work-life balance is most important and common value in NZ.

            </h3>
            <p class="p-style1"><span class="qa">A</span>:I faced a tough choice when a co-worker proposed cutting corners to meet a deadline. Feeling torn between getting the job done quickly and sticking to what's right. Considering how our actions could affect our team's reputation, I decided to stay honest. Looking back, I see how important it was to prioritise integrity over taking shortcuts.</p>

            <h3 class="head3"><span class="qa">Q</span>:Share an example of when you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss strategies you tried at the time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now and why.
            </h3>
            <p class="p-style1"><span class="qa">A</span>:I tried to share a better way to finish a job with a colleague, but he wasn't interested. I felt a bit upset and walked away. Looking back, I see the value of patience and clear communication.It's important to explain things clearly and give others time to understand. Rushing or getting frustrated doesn't help. I've learned that being patient and understanding can make a big difference in how people respond. It's a lesson I'll keep in mind for future interactions.</p>

            <h3 class="head3"><span class="qa">Q</span>:Evaluate your limitations in terms of your learning and career 
                development. How might these affect your learning journey?
            </h3>
            <p class="p-style1"><span class="qa">A</span>:My learning and career face challenges due to limited English skills and a lack of creativity. 
                Limited english proficiency not only affects communicate effectively with facilitator and cohort, but also can make it challenging to express my thoughts, questions correctly.
                Although lack of creativity might not have a big impact on my learning journey, it could affect my IT career deeply. Creativity is an ability of critical thinking, problem-solving from various angles. I think it is the pivot of being a web developer.</p>

                <p class="p-style1"><span class="qa">A</span>:Honesty and self-regulation are two of my strengths. During learning journey I will be honest with myself  about my learning goals and progress and take responsibility for learning outcomes. Self-regulation involves setting properly goals, tracking progress, and alter methods to complete learning competencies.
