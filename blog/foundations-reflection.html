        What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego
        due to the core learning?
      </p>
      <p class="p-style2">
        Growth mindset: it is never too late to learn new thing, my abilities
        and intelligence can be developed through dedication and hard work. It
        is ok to ask for help when I am stuck. Cultivating emotional
        intelligence is essential in an individual's overall success and
        well-being.

        What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and
        programming?
      </p>
      <p class="p-style2">
        Values shape the approach to programming and learning. Empathy allows me
        to understand and relate to the needs and perspectives of others,
        including users, teammate. Self-awareness involves understanding my own
        strengths, weaknesses, learning style and it enable me to understand
        when I need help.

        What has surprised you the most about the core learning?
      </p>
      <p class="p-style2">
        Before I understood what mindfulness and meditation really were, I had
        some biases against them because I thought they were connected to
        religion. But after learning that they're actually secular practices
        with proven benefits, my opinion changed. Now, I see them as useful
        tools for improving mental well-being, no matter your religious beliefs.

    <div class="div11">
      <p class="p-style2">
        What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?
      </p>
      <p class="p-style2">
        Core learning encompasses speaking and writing. My English proficiency
        poses a significant challenge, yet I view it as an opportunity for
        improvement.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="div11">
      <p class="p-style2">
        Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time
        focusing on core learning in a web development Bootcamp course?
      </p>
      <p class="p-style2">
        As programmers, we accomplish tasks using computers, but our primary
        interaction is with people. Effective communication and core learning
        aid us in this aspect.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="div11">
      <p class="p-style2">
        Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of
        time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming
        instead? Justify your answer.
      </p>
      <p class="p-style2">
        In Sprint 1, I initially focused on technical learning. However, as I
        progressed, I discovered that core learning surprised me more than
        technical learning.
