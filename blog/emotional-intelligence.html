        Hello everyone, welcome to my exploration of emotional intelligence.
        Firstly, I'd like to discuss why emotional intelligence matters. It's
        crucial because it affects how we interact with others, make decisions,
        and handle various situations in life. By developing emotional
        intelligence, we can better understand ourselves, communicate
        effectively, and navigate life's challenges more successfully.
        Throughout this journey, we'll delve into the importance of emotional
        intelligence and its impact on our daily lives. Let's embark on this
        enlightening journey together!

      <p class="p-style2">
        Emotional Intelligence as known as Emotional Quotient (EQ). It refers to
        a person's ability to recognize, understand, manage, and express
        emotions effectively, both in oneself and in others. EQ encompasses
        various skills, including empathy, self-awareness, self-regulation,
        social skills, and motivation. IQ, or Intelligence Quotient, is a
        measure of a person's cognitive abilities, including reasoning,
        problem-solving, memory, and comprehension skills. It's typically
        assessed through standardized tests and is used to gauge an individual's
        intellectual potential or capacity to learn.

        Not only does IQ capture one aspect of intelligence, but emotional
        intelligence (EQ) also plays a significant role in it. EQ affects how we
        navigate social interactions, handle stress, make decisions, and form
        relationships. For instance, I felt very stressed when dealing with
        family matters and Sprint 3 together. Learning mindfulness and
        meditation has truly opened up a new world for me, bringing me a sense
        of peace and tranquility. IQ remains relatively stable throughout life,
        EQ can be developed and improved over time through self-reflection,
        practice, and learning. Cultivating emotional intelligence is essential
        in an individual's overall success and well-being.
