        Hello everyone, welcome to my Sprint 3 - JavaScript and DOM journey. I'm
        excited to share with you what I've learned during this sprint. I'm
        eager to hear your feedback and insights. Let's dive in!
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="div2">
      <p class="p-style">
        This sprint has been the most challenging part of my bootcamp journey so
        far. Not only is it more complex than HTML and CSS, but I've also had to
        juggle family matters alongside my studies. Despite the difficulties,
        I'm determined to persevere and overcome these obstacles.
      </p>
      <p class="p-style">
        After completing JavaScript, I've gained a clearer understanding of
        <span class="fb"
          >the relationship between HTML, CSS, and JavaScript</span
        >. Let's imagine a computer as a combination of these technologies. HTML
        serves as the basic content, akin to the hardware components like CPU,
        SSD, and motherboard. CSS controls the visual styling, similar to the
        type of computer you're using, whether it's a desktop, laptop, or
        tablet. JavaScript manages interactions with the user, functioning like
        input devices such as keyboards, cameras, mice, and touchscreens. I hope
        this analogy provides a better understanding of HTML, CSS, and
        JavaScript.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="div2">
      <p class="p-style">
        <span class="fb">Control flow</span> refers to the order in which
        statements are executed in a script and is managed by conditional
        statements (if, else if, else), loops (for, while, do-while), and switch
        statements. <span class="fb">Loops</span> are control structures used to
        repeat a block of code multiple times.
      </p>
      <p class="p-style">
        Cooking for my family every day is like using control flow to prepare
        dinner. I follow a sequence of steps, such as chopping vegetables,
        marinating meat, and cooking ingredients in a specific order. Loops come
        in when I need to repeat certain steps multiple times, like chopping
        veggies or preparing meat.
      </p>
      <p class="p-style">Now, Let's talk about Arrays, Objects and Function.</p>
      <p class="p-style">
        <span class="fb">Arrays</span> store data in an ordered sequence of
        elements, each identified by an index. To access data from an array, you
        use square brackets [] notation with the index of the element you want
        to retrieve.
      </p>
      <code>const fruits = ['apple', 'pinapple', 'orange', 'banana'];</code>
      <code>console.log(fruits[2]); </code>
      <p class="p-style">
        <span class="fb">Objects</span> store data in key-value pairs and it is
        unordered, where each value is associated with a unique key. To access
        data from an object, you use dot notation (object.property) or square
        brackets notation (object['property']) with the key of the property you
        want to retrieve.
      </p>
      <code>const stock = { product: 'whiteCoffee', price: 5.99 };</code>
      <code>console.log(stock.product);</code>
      <code>console.log(stock['price'])</code>
      <p class="p-style">
        <span class="fb">Function</span> is a blocks of code for a specific task
        which is reusable. It help organize code, improve readability. It allow
        you to break down a program into smaller, more manageable parts, leading
        to shorter, more efficient programs.
      </p>
      <p class="p-style">
        Think of a function as a machine designed by people to complete a
        specific task efficiently and repeatedly. Just like machines are built
        for specific purposes, functions in programming are created to execute
        specific task or calculations to the overall functionality of the
        program.
      </p>
      <p class="p-style">
        The Document Object Model (<span class="fb">DOM</span>) is a programming
        interface for web documents. Developers can manipulate the DOM using
        JavaScript to dynamically update the content, structure, and style of
        web pages.
      </p>
      <p class="p-style">
        While working on the JavaScript-cafe project, after completing each
        function, I made it a habit to immediately call the function to observe
        its behavior. If something unexpected occurred, I would inspect the DOM
        to identify and rectify any issues. The DOM acted as a guide,
        pinpointing errors and their locations, aiding in troubleshooting and
        ensuring smooth functionality.
